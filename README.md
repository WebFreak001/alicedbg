# Alice Debugger Project

**Please note that this is still is very early development!**

The alicedbg project aims to be an easy-to-use, simple debugger, object dumper,
and profiler. Either as a stand-alone program or as a library.

_Why not just use GDB or LLDB?_ One might ask.

_Why not make one from scratch myself?_ I asked myself.

Personal Goals:

- [ ] Make the debugging engine available to D user applications via templates.
- [ ] Make a usable Text UI close to a professional debugger
- [ ] Debug an application on my Raspberry Pi 3B+ and my Purism Librem 5
- [ ] Disassemble ARM instructions with the Intel syntax
- [ ] Embed, as a library, into an embedded HTTP server to provide a local WebUI
- [ ] Make a disassembly as a service

Most of the help topics can be found in the repository Wiki.
